"As with most things in life, there is no single right or wrong way to approach a problem. There are usually many ways
to tackle the same problem. So when attempting to design an OO solu- tion, don’t get hung up in trying to do a perfect
design the first time (there will always be room for improvement). What you really need to do is brainstorm and let your
thought process go in different directions. Do not try to conform to any standards or conventions when trying to solve a
problem because the whole idea is to be creative.  
In fact, at the start of the process, don’t even begin to consider a specific programming language. The first order of
business is to identify and solve business problems. Work on the conceptual analysis and design first. Think about
specific technologies only when they are fundamental to the business problem. For example, you can’t design a wireless
network without wireless technology. However, it is often the case that you will have more than one software solution to
consider.  
Thus, before you start to design a system, or even a class, think the problem through and have some fun!"
